Here is assignment for Code Quiz

Template I used & Walk-Through on its creation can be found here -- https://dev.to/sulaimonolaniran/building-a-simple-quiz-with-html-css-and-javascript-4elp

also here is a CodePen link for easier reference if previous link is uncooperative-- https://codepen.io/Sulaimon-Olaniran/pen/zYKJLjK

I adjusted color scheme, background, questions (added 5 more from staring set of 25) & Pseudo Code in questions.js file to make it more colorful and for clarity on what each function & if/else statement is attempting to do. Rest of code is unchanged.

It also uses an array titled shuffledQuestions to make game have different questions each time you play.
It takes 10 random questions from a possible set of 30
Questions themselves are sourced from this website -- https://www.randomtriviagenerator.com/

Any questions/comments feel free to ask/add.

Thank you & take care
